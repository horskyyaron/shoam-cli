# CLI tool for the courses catalog.

In BIU there is a courses catalog called "shoam".
Since i'm tired of going online each time i want to figure out something about a spesific course,
or even what is the course with the code 89220? (algo 1 of course).

The process is not fast enough, thus "shoam" came to be!
